## Fountain Format Integration

The character database automatically works with Fountain screenplay format:

```fountain
Title: My Screenplay
Author: John Doe

# Act 1

## Scene 1

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

JOHN sits at a table, reading a newspaper.

JOHN
(anxious)
I can't believe this is happening.

MARY enters, looking around nervously.

MARY
John? Is that you?

JOHN
Mary! I thought you'd never come.
```

In this example, the system would automatically detect:
- **JOHN**: Character with dialogue and action
- **MARY**: Character with dialogue
- Track dialogue counts, scene appearances, and character interactions

## Best Practices

### Character Organization
1. **Use Consistent Names**: Keep character names consistent throughout your screenplay
2. **Add Descriptions**: Fill in character descriptions for better tracking
3. **Set Goals & Conflicts**: Define clear character motivations
4. **Use Tags**: Tag characters for easy filtering (e.g., "protagonist", "antagonist", "supporting")

### Arc Management
1. **Plan Arcs Early**: Set up character arcs at the beginning of your project
2. **Break Down Milestones**: Create specific milestones for each arc
3. **Update Progress**: Regularly update arc and milestone status
4. **Link to Scenes**: Connect arcs to specific scenes for better tracking

### Relationship Tracking
1. **Map Relationships**: Create relationship entries for all character interactions
2. **Track Evolution**: Update relationship strength as the story progresses
3. **Add Context**: Include descriptions of how relationships develop

### Note Taking
1. **Research Notes**: Add research notes for character development
2. **Inspiration Notes**: Document character inspiration sources
3. **Development Notes**: Track character evolution throughout the story
4. **Scene Notes**: Link notes to specific scenes for context

## Troubleshooting

### Characters Not Detected
- Ensure character names are in ALL CAPS in Fountain format
- Check that character names are on separate lines from dialogue
- Verify Fountain syntax is correct

### Data Not Saving
- Character data saves automatically to UserDefaults
- Check that you have write permissions
- Restart the app if data appears to be lost

### Performance Issues
- Large character databases may slow down with many characters
- Consider using tags to organize characters
- Use search and filtering to manage large character lists
